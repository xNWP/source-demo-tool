# Source Demo Tool
```⚠️WORK IN PROGRESS⚠️```

A Rust library for viewing the internals of source engine demo (.dem) files. Currently the library is being developed alongside [Source Demo Crawler](https://github.com/xNWP/source-demo-crawler), a practical implementation of the libraries features.

Checkout `CHANGELOG.md` for details on the current state of the library, and checkout the tags for specific releases. `main` should always be stable and you should be able to build from the latest main commit with no errors, if you do have problems, please [open an issue](https://github.com/xNWP/source-demo-tool/issues).
